It provides young people with the knowledge and skills that will assist them in their personal development and address the physical and social needs of their communities. The Rotaract Club's passion for service and excellence is driven by Rotary International's vision of "service above self". Thus, the club commits itself to society and following the motto of Rotaract: fellowship through service, it enables the Rotaractors to make lifelong friends and to give back to the community they live in.</p>
