            <h2>REFLECTIONS</h2>
            <p>
                Reflections is a platform for all the young minds of Hassan to portray their
                talent and their creativity. It is a place where we witness the magic of
                young minds!! Reflections in carried out for 14 long years and will continue to do
                so. It is an attempt to unravel the talent and creativity of little souls. We
                host the event for students in and around Hassan and witness
                a spectrum of young kids whose talents are flawlessly crafted. Team spirit
                to prevail over one's own stardom and the overall championship is upheld.
                Reflections championship trophy was bagged by schools like Hassan Public School, Podar InternationalSchool, Netaji Public school etc. The
                scholarship is also rewarded for the most deserved. Participants with a wide
                aura of talent are encouraged here, as this event is a combination of
                cultural, literary, science, art, and creative spheres. We contrived Sparshaartha, as a part of Reflections. The event is for visually
                challenged students of Blind school, Hassan. This event is our humble effort
                to value the special talents in them by providing a platform. This event boosts
                the enthusiasm of specially born children and makes them feel strong and
                confident.
